# SQL Data Analysis Portfolio Projects

## Overview

This repository showcases two SQL projects designed to demonstrate expertise in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Each project involves working with realistic datasets to solve problems and extract actionable insights. These projects highlight proficiency in SQL queries, data manipulation, and analytical thinking.

## Projects

### 1. **Data Cleaning Project**

#### File: `Portfolio Project - Data Cleaning.sql`

#### Objective:

To clean and prepare a raw dataset for further analysis. The focus is on identifying and resolving data quality issues such as:

- Missing or null values
- Duplicate records
- Standardizing formats
- Handling inconsistent data entries

#### Key Steps:

- Identified and removed duplicate rows.
- Handled missing values using appropriate strategies such as imputation or removal.
- Standardized inconsistent data formats (e.g., dates, strings).
- Ensured referential integrity in relational data.

#### Outcomes:

- A clean and well-structured dataset, ready for downstream analytical tasks.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project**

#### File: `Portfolio Project - Exploratory Data Analysis.sql`

#### Objective:

To analyze and extract meaningful insights from a dataset. The focus is on using SQL to:

- Explore data distributions and relationships.
- Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- Generate summary statistics.
- Create visualizations (if applicable) through SQL-compatible tools.

#### Key Steps:

- Calculated key metrics such as averages, counts, and distributions.
- Segmented data by relevant dimensions (e.g., time, categories).
- Identified correlations and trends within the dataset.
- Provided actionable recommendations based on findings.

#### Outcomes:

- A detailed understanding of the dataset, with insights ready to inform decision-making.
