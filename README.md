# SQL Data Analysis Portfolio Projects

## Overview

This repository showcases two SQL projects designed to demonstrate expertise in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). Each project involves working with realistic datasets to solve problems and extract actionable insights. These projects highlight proficiency in SQL queries, data manipulation, and analytical thinking.

## Projects

### 1. **Data Cleaning Project**

#### File: `Portfolio Project - Data Cleaning.sql`

#### Objective:

To clean and prepare a raw dataset for further analysis. The focus is on identifying and resolving data quality issues such as:

- Missing or null values
- Duplicate records
- Standardizing formats
- Handling inconsistent data entries

#### Key Steps:

- Identified and removed duplicate rows.
- Handled missing values using appropriate strategies such as imputation or removal.
- Standardized inconsistent data formats (e.g., dates, strings).
- Ensured referential integrity in relational data.

#### Outcomes:

- A clean and well-structured dataset, ready for downstream analytical tasks.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project**

#### File: `Portfolio Project - Exploratory Data Analysis.sql`

#### Objective:

To analyze and extract meaningful insights from a dataset. The focus is on using SQL to:

- Explore data distributions and relationships.
- Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- Generate summary statistics.
- Create visualizations (if applicable) through SQL-compatible tools.

#### Key Steps:

- Calculated key metrics such as averages, counts, and distributions.
- Segmented data by relevant dimensions (e.g., time, categories).
- Identified correlations and trends within the dataset.
- Provided actionable recommendations based on findings.

#### Outcomes:

- A detailed understanding of the dataset, with insights ready to inform decision-making.

1. **Company:** Name of the company that conducted layoffs.
2. **Location:** Headquarters or location where layoffs occurred.
3. **Industry:** The sector in which the company operates (e.g., Finance, Retail).
4. **# Total\_Laid\_Off:** Total number of employees laid off by the company.
5. **% Laid Off:** Percentage of the workforce affected by layoffs.
6. **Date:** Date on which the layoffs occurred or were announced.
7. **Stage:** Funding stage or growth stage of the company (e.g., Series A, Post-IPO).
8. **Country:** Country where the company is headquartered or layoffs were reported.
9. **# Funds\_Raised:** Total funds raised by the company (in millions) prior to layoffs.

#### **Insights:**

- Layoffs are concentrated in tech hubs such as SF Bay Area and New York City.
- The United States accounts for 65% of layoffs in the dataset.
- Companies in industries like Finance, Retail, and Media faced significant layoffs.
- Many well-funded companies also conducted layoffs, indicating broader economic pressures.

#### **Use Cases:**

- Trend analysis over time.
- Correlation studies between funding, layoffs, and company stages.
